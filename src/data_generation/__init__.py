"""
Quantum circuit data generation package.

This package provides comprehensive tools for generating datasets of random quantum
circuits using Cirq. It includes modules for circuit generation, simulation with
noise models, optimization using Cirq's built-in routines, and command-line scripts
for dataset creation. The package is designed to support machine learning workflows
that require quantum circuit training data.
