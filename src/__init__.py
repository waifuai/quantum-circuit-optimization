"""
Quantum circuit optimization source package.

This package serves as the main source directory for the quantum circuit optimization
project. It contains two primary subpackages: data_generation for creating quantum
circuit datasets using Cirq, and model_training for AI-powered circuit optimization
using large language models. The package provides a complete toolkit for quantum
circuit optimization workflows from data generation to AI-powered optimization.
